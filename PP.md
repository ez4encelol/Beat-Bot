# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data Beat Bop collects and how it is used.

# Information We Collect
Beat Bop does not store personal data such as names, emails, or messages. However, to function properly, Beat Bop may temporarily process the following:

- Server IDs and Channel IDs (to join voice channels and manage playback)

- User IDs (for command processing)

- Message content of commands only (for slash commands or prefix commands like /play)

All processed data is temporary and not stored in any database.

# How We Use Information
Beat Bop only uses the above information to:

- Respond to music commands (play, pause, skip, etc.)

- Join and leave voice channels when requested

- Maintain a temporary playback queue per server

- BotHub does not sell, share, or store the Clients data.

# Third-Party Services
Beat Bop uses the following third-party services:

- Discord API – to operate within Discord

- YouTube / yt-dlp – to fetch and play audio streams

# Data Retention
No persistent data is stored.

Temporary data (like music queues) exists only in memory and is cleared when Beat Bop Joins or leaves the server.

# User Rights
The Client may remove Beat Bop at any time to stop all temporary data processing. Since BotHub does not store personal data, there is nothing to delete beyond removing the Bot from the Clients server.
